This interest evolved with my daily work with web applications over the last few years, reviewing already developed web application source code, modifying it at times in order to resolve a customer issue and needing to dive deep and debug customer problems in production.\nBut I always felt that my daily work was only focusing on how to resolve an issue for a customer. I never branched out to actually understanding the security behind the web applications and services I\u2019m debug and the code I was reviewing and modifying. Moreover, I felt that I was not able to identify any security vulnerabilities in the applications I was working with.\nSo I challenged to take this next step in learning more about web application security vulnerabilities by signing up to ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://2021.angstromctf.com",children:"\xe5ngstromCTF 2021"}),", an annual capture-the-flag competition hosted by Montgomery Blair High School (ironically located very near to the high school I attended in Maryland).\nThis post describes the process by which I was able to finish one of the challenges called Jar under the Web category."]})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(p,{...e})}):p(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>l});var i=n(96540);const o={},a=i.createContext(o);function s(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function l(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
