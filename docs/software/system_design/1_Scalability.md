Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or growing amounts of data without sacrificing performance or availability.

## Key Strategies

- Horizontal scaling: more nodes
- Vertical scaling: more processing power
- Caching
- Load balancing: distribute traffic among multiple servers.
- Database sharding: distribute dataset across multiple DBs.
