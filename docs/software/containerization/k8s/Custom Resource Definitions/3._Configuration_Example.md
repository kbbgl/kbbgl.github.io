## Configuration Example

  name: backups.stable.linux.com
spec:
  group: stable.linux.com

### Explanation of Configuration Fields

`apiVersion`: This should match the current level of stability, which is apiextensions.k8s.io/v1.

`kind`: The object type being inserted by the `kube-apiserver`.

`name`: The name must match the spec field declared later. The syntax must be `<plural name>.<group>`.

`group`: The group name will become part of the REST API under `/apis/<group>/<version>` or `/apis/stable/v1` in this case with the version set to `v1`.

`scope`: Determines if the object exists in a single namespace or is cluster-wide.

`plural`: Defines the last part of the API URL, such as `apis/stable/v1/backups`.

`singular/shotNames`: They represent the name displayed and make CLI usage easier.

`kind`: A CamelCased singular type used in resource manifests.
