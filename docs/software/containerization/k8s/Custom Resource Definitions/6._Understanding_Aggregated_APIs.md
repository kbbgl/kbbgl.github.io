## Understanding Aggregated APIs

The use of `Aggregated` APIs allows adding additional Kubernetes-type API servers to the cluster. The added server acts as a subordinate to `kube-apiserver`, which, as of v1.7, runs the aggregation layer in-process. When an extension resource is registered, the aggregation layer watches a passed URL path and proxies any requests to the newly registered API service. 

The aggregation layer is easy to enable. Edit the flags passed during startup of the `kube-apiserver` to include `--enable-aggregator-routing=true`. Some vendors enable this feature by default. 

The creation of the exterior can be done via YAML configuration files or APIs. Configuring TLS authorization between components and RBAC rules for various new objects is also required. A [sample API server is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver). A project currently in the incubation stage is an API server builder which should handle much of the security and connection configuration.
