## New Object Defnition

```yaml
apiVersion: "stable.linux.com/v1"
kind: BackUp
metadata:
  name: a-backup-object
spec:
  timeSpec: "* * * * */5"
  image: linux-backup-image
replicas: 5
```

Note that the `apiVersion` and `kind` match the `CRD` we created in a previous step. The spec parameters depend on the controller.

The object will be evaluated by the controller. If the syntax, such as `timeSpec`, does not match the expected value, you will receive and error, should validation be configured. Without validation, only the existence of the variable is checked, not its details.
