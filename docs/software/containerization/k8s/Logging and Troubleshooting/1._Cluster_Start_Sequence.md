## Cluster Start Sequence

The cluster startup sequence begins with `systemd` if you built the cluster using `kubeadm`. Other tools may leverage a different method. Use:

```bash
systemctl status kubelet.service
```
to see the current state and configuration files used to run the `kubelet` binary.

Uses `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf`

Inside of the `config.yaml` file you will find several settings for the binary, including the `staticPodPath` which indicates the directory where `kubelet` will read every `yaml` file and start every pod. If you put a `yaml` file in this directory, it is a way to troubleshoot the scheduler, as the pod is created with any requests to the scheduler.

Uses `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` configuration file
`staticPodPath` is set to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`
The four default yaml files will start the base pods necessary to run the cluster:

`kubelet` creates all pods from `*.yaml` in directory: `kube-apiserver`, `etcd`, `kube-controller-manager`, `kube-scheduler`.
Once the watch loops and controllers from `kube-controller-manager` run using `etcd` data, the rest of the configured objects will be created.
