## Service Mesh

For more complex connections or resources such as service discovery, rate limiting, traffic management and advanced metrics, you may want to implement a service mesh.

A service mesh consists of edge and embedded proxies communicating with each other and handling traffic based on rules from a control plane. Various options are available, including **Envoy**, **Istio**, and **linkerd**.

- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/): is a modular and extensible proxy favored due to its modular construction, open architecture and dedication to remaining unmonetized. It is often used as a data plane under other tools of a service mesh.
- Istio is a powerful tool set which leverages Envoy proxies via a multi-component control plane. It is built to be platform-independent, and it can be used to make the service mesh flexible and feature-filled.
- [linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) is another service mesh, purposely built to be easy to deploy, fast, and ultralight.
