## `Ingress` Controller

An `Ingress` Controller is a daemon running in a `Pod` which watches the `/ingresses` endpoint on the API server, which is found under the networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API group.

Multiple Ingress Controllers can be deployed. Traffic should use annotations to select the proper controller. The lack of a matching annotation will cause every controller to attempt to satisfy the ingress traffic.

The most popular `Ingress` Controller is [`nginx`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/deploy). 

As with any Ingress Controller, there are some configuration requirements for proper deployment. Customization can be done via a `ConfigMap`, `Annotations`.
