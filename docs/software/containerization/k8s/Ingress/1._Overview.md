## Overview

An `Ingress` Controller serves as a proxy/gateway and distributes requests into applications based on path. 
You can deploy multiple controllers, each with unique configurations. A controller uses `Ingress` Rules to handle traffic to and from outside the cluster.  
An `Ingress` Rule is an API resource that you can create with `kubectl`. When you create that resource, it reprograms and reconfigures your `Ingress` Controller to allow traffic to flow from the outside to an internal service. 

You can leave a service as a `ClusterIP` type and define how the traffic gets routed to that internal service using an `Ingress` Rule.
