## Cluster High Availability

A newer feature of `kubeadm` is the integrated ability to join multiple master nodes with collocated `etcd` databases. This allows for higher redundancy and fault tolerance. As long as the database services the cluster will continue to run and catch up with `kubelet` information should the master node go down and be brought back online. 

Three instances are required for `etcd` to be able to determine quorum if the data is accurate, or if the data is corrupt, the database could become unavailable. Once `etcd` is able to determine quorum, it will elect a leader and return to functioning as it had before failure. 

One can either collocate the database with control planes or use an external `etcd` database cluster. The `kubeadm` command makes the collocated deployment easier to use. 

To ensure that workers and other control planes continue to have access, it is a good idea to use a load balancer. The default configuration leverages SSL, so you may need to configure the load balancer as a TCP pass through unless you want the extra work of certificate configuration. As the certificates will be decoded only for particular node names, it is a good idea to use a FQDN instead of an IP address, although there are many possible ways to handle access.
