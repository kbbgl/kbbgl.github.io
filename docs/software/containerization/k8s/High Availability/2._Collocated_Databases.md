## Collocated Databases

The easiest way to gain higher availability is to use the `kubeadm` command and join at least two more master servers to the cluster. The command is almost the same as a worker join except an additional `--control-plane` flag and a `certificate-key`. The key will probably need to be generated unless the other master nodes are added within two hours of the cluster initialization.

Should a node fail, you would lose both a control plane and a database. As the database is the one object that cannot be rebuilt, this may not be an important issue.
