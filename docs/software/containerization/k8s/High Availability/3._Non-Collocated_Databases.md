Using an external cluster of `etcd` allows for less interruption should a node fail. Creating a cluster in this manner requires a lot more equipment to properly spread out services and takes more work to configure. 

The external `etcd` cluster needs to be configured first. The `kubeadm` command has options to configure this cluster, or other options are available. Once the `etcd` cluster is running, the certificates need to be manually copied to the intended first control plane node. 

The `kubeadm-config.yaml` file needs to be populated with the `etcd` set to external, endpoints, and the certificate locations. Once the first control plane is fully initialized, the redundant control planes need to be added one at a time, each fully initialized before the next is added.
