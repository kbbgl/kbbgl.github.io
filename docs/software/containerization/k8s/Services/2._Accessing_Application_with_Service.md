## Accessing an Application within a `Service`

To create a `Service` for a `Deployment`:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment/nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
# service/nginx-deployment exposed

kubectl get svc
# NAME               TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
# nginx-deployment   NodePort   10.133.63.157   <none>        80:32289/TCP   48s
```

We can then access the application by going to the address `http://$server_IP:32289`.
