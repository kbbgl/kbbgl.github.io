## Service Types

Service types can be specified as an argument to the `kubectl expose` command or inside of a `Service` specification.

- `ClusterIP`: The default type which provides only internal access.
- `NodePort`: Great for debugging or when static IP is necessary.
- `LoadBalancer`: The `LoadBalancer` service was created to pass requests to a cloud provider like GKE or AWS. Private cloud solutions also may implement this service type if there is a cloud provider plugin, such as with CloudStack and OpenStack. Even without a cloud provider, the address is made available to public traffic, and packets are spread among the Pods in the deployment automatically.
- `ExternalName`: It has no selectors, nor does it define ports or endpoints. It allows the return of an alias to an external service. The redirection happens at the DNS level, not via a proxy or forward. 

The `kubectl proxy` command creates a local service to access a ClusterIP. This can be useful for troubleshooting or development work.
