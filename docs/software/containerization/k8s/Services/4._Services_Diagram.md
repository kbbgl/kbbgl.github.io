## `Service`s Diagram

Kubernetes latest versions starting in 1.11 uses the `ipvs` proxy mode.

IPVS (IP Virtual Server) is built on top of the Netfilter and implements transport-layer load balancing as part of the Linux kernel. In `ipvs` mode, `kube-proxy` watches Kubernetes `Services` and `Endpoints`, calls `netlink` interface to create IPVS rules accordingly and synchronizes IPVS rules with Kubernetes `Services` and `Endpoints` periodically. This control loop ensures that IPVS status matches the desired state. When accessing a `Service`, IPVS directs traffic to one of the backend Pods.

IPVS provides more options for balancing traffic to backend Pods; these are:

`rr`: round-robin
`lc`: least connection (smallest number of open connections)
`dh`: destination hashing
`sh`: source hashing
`sed`: shortest expected delay
`nq`: never queue

IPVS mode is configured via `--proxy-mode=ipvs`. It implicitly uses IPVS NAT mode for service port mapping.
