## Local Proxy for Development

When developing an application or service, one quick way to check your service is to run a local proxy with `kubectl`. It will capture the shell, unless you place it in the background. When running, you can make calls to the Kubernetes API on localhost and also reach the `ClusterIP` services on their API URL. The IP and port where the proxy listens can be configured with command arguments. 

Run a proxy:
```bash
$ kubectl proxy
Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001
```

Next, to access a `ghost` service using the local proxy, we could use the following URL, for example, at http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/ghost.

If the service port has a name, the path will be http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/ghost:<port_name>.
