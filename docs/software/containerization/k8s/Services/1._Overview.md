## Overview

`Service`s are agents which connect `Pod`s together or provide access outside of the cluster. The `Pod` serves the expected resource using an `Endpoint` object.

Each `Service` can be exposed internally or externally to the cluster. A `Service` can also connect internal resources to external resources.

The `kube-proxy` agent watches the Kubernetes API for new services and endpoints being created on each node. It opens random ports and listens for traffic to the `ClusterIP:Port`, and redirects the traffic to the randomly generated service endpoints.

`Service`s provide automatic load-balancing, matching a label query. While there is no configuration of this option, there is the possibility of session affinity via IP. Also, a headless service, one without a fixed IP nor load-balancing, can be configured. Labels are used to determine which Pods should receive traffic from a service (**Service Update Pattern**).

Unique IP addresses are assigned and configured via the `etcd` database, so that `Service`s implement `iptables` to route traffic, but could leverage other technologies to provide access to resources in the future.
