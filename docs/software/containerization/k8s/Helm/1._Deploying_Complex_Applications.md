## Deploying Complex Applications

We have used Kubernetes tools to deploy simple Docker applications. Starting with the v1.4 release, the goal was to have a canonical location for software. Helm is similar to a package manager like `yum` or `apt`, with a **chart** being similar to a package. Helm v3 is significantly different than v2.

A typical containerized application will have several **manifests**. Manifests for `Deployments`, `Services`, and `ConfigMaps`. You will probably also create some secrets, `Ingress`, and other objects. Each of these will need a manifest. 

With Helm, you can package all those manifests and make them available as a single tarball. You can put the tarball in a repository, search that repository, discover an application, and then, with a single command, deploy and start the entire application. 

The server runs in your Kubernetes cluster, and your client is local, even a local laptop. With your client, you can connect to multiple repositories of applications. 

You will also be able to upgrade or roll back an application easily from the command line.
