# Helm V2 and Tiller

The `helm` tool packages a Kubernetes application using a series of YAML files into a `chart`, or package. This allows for simple sharing between users, tuning using a templating scheme, as well as provenance tracking, among other things.

Helm v2 is made of two components:

- A server called `Tiller`, which runs inside your Kubernetes cluster.
- A client called `Helm`, which runs on your local machine.

Helm version 2 uses a `Tiller` `Pod` to deploy in the cluster. This has led to a lot of issues with security and cluster permissions. The new Helm v3 does not deploy a pod.

With the Helm client you can browse package repositories (containing published `Charts`), and deploy those `Charts` on your Kubernetes cluster. Helm will download the chart and pass a request to Tiller to create a release, otherwise known as an instance of a chart. The release will be made of various resources running in the Kubernetes cluster.
