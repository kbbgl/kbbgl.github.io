## Chart Contents

A chart is an archived set of Kubernetes resource manifests that make up a distributed application. You can learn more from the [Helm 3 documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/). Others exist and can be easily created, for example by a vendor providing software. Charts are similar to the use of independent YUM repositories.

```
├── Chart.yaml 
├── README.md
├── templates
│   ├── NOTES.txt
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── pvc.yaml
│   ├── secrets.yaml
│   └── svc.yaml
└── values.yaml
```

`Chart.yaml`: Contains some metadata about the Chart, like its name, version, keywords, and so on, in this case, for MariaDB.

`values.yaml`: Contains keys and values that are used to generate the release in your cluster. These values are replaced in the resource manifests using the Go templating syntax.

`templates`: Contains the resource manifests that make up this MariaDB application.
