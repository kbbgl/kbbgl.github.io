To deploy a `helm` chart, you can just use the `helm install` command. There may be several required resources for the installation to be successful, such as available `PV`s to match chart `PVC`. Currently, the only way to discover which resources need to exist is by reading the `README`s for each chart :

```bash
helm install testing/redis-standalone
Fetched testing/redis-standalone to redis-standalone-0.0.1.tgz
amber-eel
Last Deployed: Fri Oct 21 12:24:01 2016
Namespace: default
Status: DEPLOYED

Resources:
==> v1/ReplicationController
NAME             DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE
redis-standalone 1       1       0     1s

==> v1/Service
NAME  CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S)  AGE
redis 10.0.81.67 <none>      6379/TCP 0s
```
You will be able to list the release, delete it, even upgrade it and roll back.

```bash
helm list
NAME      REVISION UPDATED                  STATUS   CHART
amber-eel 1        Fri Oct 21 12:24:01 2016 DEPLOYED redis-standalone-0.0.1
```

A unique, colorful name will be created for each helm instance deployed. You can also use `kubectl` to view new resources Helm created in your cluster. 

The output of the deployment should be carefully reviewed. It often includes information on access to the applications within. If your cluster did not have a required cluster resource, the output is often the first place to begin troubleshooting.


The downloaded `helm` package will be found in:

```bash
ls ~/.cache/helm/repository/
redis-standalone-0.0.1.tgz
```
