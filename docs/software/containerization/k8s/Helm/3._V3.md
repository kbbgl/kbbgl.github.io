## Helm V3

With the near complete overhaul of Helm, the processes and commands have changed quite a bit. Expect to spend some time updating and integrating these changes if you are currently using Helm v2.

One of the most noticeable changes is the removal of the `Tiller` pod. This was an ongoing security issue, as the pod needed elevated permissions to deploy charts. The functionality is in the command alone, and no longer requires initialization to use.

In version 2, an update to a chart and deployment used a 2-way strategic merge for patching. This compared the previous manifest to the intended manifest, but not the possible edits done outside of helm commands. The third way now checked is the live state of objects.

Among other changes, software installation no longer generates a name automatically. One must be provided, or the `--generated-name` option must be passed.
