## Chart Repositories 

A default repository is included when initializing `helm`, but it's common to add other repositories. Repositories are currently simple HTTP servers that contain an index file and a tarball of all the Charts present. 

You can interact with a repository using the `helm repo` commands.

```bash
helm repo add testing http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-testing

helm repo list
NAME URL
stable http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts
local http://localhost:8879/charts
testing http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts...
```

Once you have a repository available, you can search for Charts based on keywords. Below, we search for a redis Chart:

```bash
helm search redis
WARNING: Deprecated index file format. Try 'helm repo update'
NAME                     VERSION DESCRIPTION
testing/redis-cluster    0.0.5   Highly available Redis cluster with multiple se...
testing/redis-standalone 0.0.1   Standalone Redis Master testing/...
```

Once you find the chart within a repository, you can deploy it on your cluster.
