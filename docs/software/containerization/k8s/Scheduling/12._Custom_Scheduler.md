## Custom Scheduler

If the default scheduling mechanisms (affinity, taints, policies) are not flexible enough for your needs, you can write your own scheduler. Existing scheduler code can be found in the [`Scheduler` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/scheduler).

If a `Pod` specification does not declare which scheduler to use, the standard scheduler is used by default. If the `Pod` declares a scheduler, and that container is not running, the `Pod` would remain in a `Pending` state forever. 

The end result of the scheduling process is that a `Pod` gets a binding that specifies which node it should run on. A binding is a Kubernetes API primitive in the `api/v1` group. Technically, without any scheduler running, you could still schedule a `Pod` on a node, by specifying a binding for that `Pod`. 

You can also run multiple schedulers simultaneously.

You can view the scheduler and other information with:
```bash
kubectl get events
```
