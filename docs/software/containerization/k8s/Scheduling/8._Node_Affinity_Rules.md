## Node Affinity Rules

Where `Pod` affinity/anti-affinity has to do with other `Pod`s, the use of `nodeAffinity` allows `Pod` scheduling based on node labels. This is similar and will some day replace the use of the `nodeSelector` setting. The scheduler will not look at other `Pod`s on the system, but the labels of the nodes. This should have much less performance impact on the cluster, even with a large number of nodes.

- Uses `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist` operators
- `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
- `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
- `requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution`.


Until `nodeSelector` has been fully deprecated, **both the selector and required labels must be met for a Pod to be scheduled.**
