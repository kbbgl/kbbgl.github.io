## `Pod` Specification

Most scheduling decisions can be made as part of a `Pod` specification. The different fields that control scheduling are:

- `nodeName`/`nodeSelector`: The `nodeName` and `nodeSelector` options allow a `Pod` to be assigned to a single node or a group of nodes with particular labels.

    A `Pod` specification such as the one below would ensure that the `Pod` is scheduled only on nodes that have the label `net: fast` applied to them. All listed `nodeSelector`  must be met to be scheduled (but the node might have more labels). The `Pod` would remain `Pending` if not.
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
  nodeSelector:
    net: fast
```


- `affinity`: `affinity` and `anti-affinity` can be used to require or prefer which node is used by the scheduler. If using a preference instead, a matching node is chosen first, but other nodes would be used if no match is present.
- `schedulerName`: Should none of the options above meet the needs of the cluster, there is also the ability to deploy a custom scheduler. Each `Pod` could then include a `schedulerName` to choose which schedule to use.
- `tolerations`: The use of `taints` allows a node to be labeled such that `Pod`s would not be scheduled for some reason, such as the master node after initialization. A `toleration` allows a `Pod` to ignore the `taint` and be scheduled assuming other requirements are met.
