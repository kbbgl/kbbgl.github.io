## Node Affinity Example

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity: 
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:  
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/colo-tx-name
            operator: In
            values:
            - tx-aus
            - tx-dal
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: disk-speed
            operator: In
            values:
            - fast
            - quick 
```

The first `nodeAffinity` rule requires a node with a key of `kubernetes.io/colo-tx-name` which has one of two possible values: `tx-aus` or `tx-dal`. 

The second rule gives extra weight to nodes with a key of `disk-speed` with a value of `fast` or `quick`. The `Pod` will be scheduled on some node - in any case, this just prefers a particular label.
