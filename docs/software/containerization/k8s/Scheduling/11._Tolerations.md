## Tolerations

Setting tolerations on a node are used to schedule `Pods` on tainted nodes. This provides an easy way to avoid `Pod`s using the node. Only those with a particular toleration would be scheduled.

An operator can be included in a `Pod` specification, defaulting to `Equal` if not declared. The use of the operator `Equal` requires a value to match. The `Exists` operator should not be specified. If an empty key uses the `Exists` operator, it will tolerate every taint. If there is no effect, but a key and operator are declared, all effects are matched with the declared key.

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "server"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "ap-east"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
```

In the above example, the Pod will remain on the server with a key of `server` and a value of `ap-east` for 3600 seconds after the node has been tainted with `NoExecute`. When the time runs out, the Pod will be evicted.
