## `podAffinity`/`podAntiAffinity` Examples

### `podAffinity`

An example of `affinity` and `podAffinity` settings can be seen below. This also requires a particular `label` to be matched when the `Pod` starts, but not required if the `label` is later removed. 

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - S1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
```

Inside the declared topology zone, the `Pod` can be scheduled on a node running a `Pod` with a key label of `security` and a value of `S1`. If this requirement is not met, the `Pod` will remain in a `Pending` state.


### `podAntiAffinity`

With `podAntiAffinity`, we can prefer to avoid nodes with a particular label. In this case, the scheduler will prefer to avoid a node with a key set to `security` and value of `S2`. 

```yaml
podAntiAffinity:
  preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - weight: 100
    podAffinityTerm:
      labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: security
          operator: In
          values:
          - S2
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname 
```

In a large, varied environment, there may be multiple situations to be avoided. As a preference, this setting tries to avoid certain labels, but will still schedule the Pod on some node. As the `Pod` will still run, we can provide a weight to a particular rule. The weights can be declared as a value from 1 to 100. The scheduler then tries to choose, or avoid the node with the greatest combined value.
