## Predicates

The scheduler goes through a set of filters, or predicates, to find available nodes, then ranks each node using priority functions. The node with the highest rank is selected to run the Pod. 


Order of predicates:
```
predicatesOrdering = {
    CheckNodeConditionPred, 
    GeneralPred, 
    HostNamePred, 
    PodFitsHostPortsPred,
    MatchNodeSelectorPred, 
    PodFitsResourcesPred, 
    NoDiskConflictPred,
    PodToleratesNodeTaintsPred, 
    PodToleratesNodeNoExecuteTaintsPred,
    CheckNodeLabelPresencePred, 
    checkServiceAffinityPred,
    MaxEBSVolumeCountPred, 
    MaxGCEPDVolumeCountPred,
    MaxAzureDiskVolumeCountPred, 
    CheckVolumeBindingPred,
    NoVolumeZoneConflictPred, 
    CheckNodeMemoryPressurePred,
    CheckNodeDiskPressurePred, 
    MatchInterPodAffinityPred
}
```

The predicates, such as `PodFitsHost` or `NoDiskConflict`, are evaluated in a particular and configurable order. In this way, a node has the least amount of checks for new `Pod` deployment, which can be useful to exclude a node from unnecessary checks if the node is not in the proper condition. 

For example, there is a filter called `HostNamePred`, which is also known as `HostName`, which filters out nodes that do not match the node name specified in the pod specification. Another predicate is `PodFitsResources` to make sure that the available CPU and memory can fit the resources required by the Pod. 

The scheduler can be updated by passing a configuration of kind: `Policy`, which can order predicates, give special weights to priorities, and even `hardPodAffinitySymmetricWeight`, which deploys `Pod`s such that if we set `Pod` A to run with `Pod` B, then `Pod` B should automatically be run with `Pod` A.
