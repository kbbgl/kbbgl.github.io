## Authentication

There are three main points to remember with authentication in Kubernetes:

- In its straightforward form, authentication is done with certificates, tokens or basic authentication (i.e. username and password).
- Users are not created by the API, but should be managed by an external system.
- System accounts are used by processes to access the API (to learn more read [Configure Service Accounts for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).

There are two more advanced authentication mechanisms:
- Webhooks can be used to verify bearer tokens
- Connection with an external OpenID provider.

The type of authentication used is defined in the `kube-apiserver` startup options. Below are four examples of a subset of configuration options that would need to be set depending on what choice of authentication mechanism you choose:

- `--basic-auth-file`

- `--oidc-issuer-url`

- `--token-auth-file`

- `--authorization-webhook-config-file`

One or more Authenticator Modules are used: 

- x509 Client Certs; 
- static token, bearer or bootstrap token; 
- static password file; 
- service account;
- OpenID connect tokens. 

Each is tried until successful, and the order is not guaranteed. Anonymous access can also be enabled, otherwise you will get a 401 response.
