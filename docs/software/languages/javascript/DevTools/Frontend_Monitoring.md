# Frontend Monitoring

Debugging a web application in production may be challenging and time consuming. Try using a frontend monitoring tool that gathers all you need for troubleshooting in one single place.

Asayer is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your app behaves for every issue. It’s like having your browser’s devTools open while looking over your user’s shoulder.

Asayer lets you reproduce issues, aggregate JS errors and monitor your app’s performance. It offers plugins for capturing the state of your Redux, VueX, NgRx or MobX stores and for inspecting GraphQL queries.
