__Annotation__ is a form of metadata which provides data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations do not have direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

`@Controller` - marks the class as web controller, capable of handling the requests.

`@RequestMapping` - maps HTTP request with a path to a controller method.
