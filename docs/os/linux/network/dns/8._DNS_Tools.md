## DNS Tools

Tools for DNS testing are in three categories: server configuration testing, server information testing, and server update.

The client tools used for DNS testing require an active DNS server to send the questions to. DNS client tools formulate a standard DNS request and send it off to the default or named DNS server. The most common server on the Internet is bind.

Servers:

- `bind` (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) - May be called bind9 depending on the distribution.

Clients

- `dig`: domain information groper. Queries DNS for for domain name or ip address mapping.Output format resembles the records used by the DNS server and is excellent for debugging DNS queries.

- `host`- Simple interface for DNS queries. Excellent for use in scripts.
- `nslookup`: name server lookup, rescued from deprecation. Queries DNS for domain name or IP address mapping. Less verbose than `dig`. Available on many operating systems.
- `nsupdate`: name server update. End updates to a name server. Requires authentication and permission. Uses DNSSEC.
