# Proxy SSL

When a browser fetches an `https:// URI`, one of the following things happen:

- A `CONNECT` method request is made to the proxy server, and traffic is transparently forwarded to the destination. The proxy has no ability to filter on URI, path, query string, or other information.
- The browser directly connects to the HTTPS server, bypassing the proxy.
- [SslBump Peek and Splice](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice) - makes bumping decisions after the origin server is known.
Because the CONNECT method passes any TCP traffic, you should enable this option with care.
