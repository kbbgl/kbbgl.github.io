# Cache Hierarchy

Cache hierarchies are further extending the caching idea. Groups of cache servers working in concert can increase the caching efficiency, route the traffic to the best link, and support a higher number of clients.

There are two types of cache server hierarchy setups, which can be intermixed:

- Peer-to-Peer: Cache servers ask all or some of their peers if they have already cached content; if not, the cache server requests the content itself.
- Parent/Child:  Cache servers ask a parent server if it has content; the parent will then fetch the content on the behalf of the child.
