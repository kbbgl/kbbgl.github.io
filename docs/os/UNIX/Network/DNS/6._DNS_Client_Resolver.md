## DNS Client/Resolver

The DNS client or `/etc/resolv.conf` file nameserver entries were created at configuration time.

Some utilities that can be used to change the behavior of the resolver:

- `/etc/resolv.conf` - static file used to configure the resolver.
- `NIC` (Network Interface Configuration)
- DHCP Client - The DHCP server often provides nameserver information as part of the information sent to the DHCP client.
- `resolvconf` Service - An Ubuntu service which uses additional files like `/etc/resolvconf.conf` and the service `resolveconf.service` to optimize contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- `dnsmasq` - Sets up a mini caching DNS server and may alter the resolver configuration to look at `dnsmasq` instead of the items listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- `systemd.resolved`.
