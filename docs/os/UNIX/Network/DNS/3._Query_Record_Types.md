## Query/Record Types

Different database record types hold different information. Specifying a query type of ALL will fetch all record types. 


The different types are:

- `A`, Address Mapping Records: Return 32 bit IPv4 addresses.
- `AAAA`, IPv6 Address Records: Return 128big IPv6 address.
- `CNAME`, Canonical Name Records: Return an alias to another name.
- `MX`, Nail Exchanger Records: Return the message transfer agents (mail servers) for a domain.
- `NS`, Nameserver Records: Delegate an authoritative DNS zone nameserver.
- `PTR`, Reverse-Lookup Pointer Records: Delegate an authoritative DNS zone nameserver.
- `SOA`, Start of Authority Records: Start of Authority for a domain (domain and zone settings).
- `TXT`, Text Records: Arbitrary human-readable text, or machine-readable data for specific purposes.
