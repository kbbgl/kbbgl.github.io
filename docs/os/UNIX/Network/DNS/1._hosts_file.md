# `/etc/hosts`

A descendant of the `HOSTS.TXT` file is the hosts file. On Linux, this file resides at `/etc/hosts`. It has a very simple syntax:

```bash
# <IP ADDRESS> <HOSTNAME> [HOSTNAME or alias] ...
```

An example of an `/etc/hosts` file is the following:

```bash
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 ::1 localhost
localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

10.100.42.4 laser4 laser4.example.com

10.100.42.1 mail mail.example.com
```

This hosts file usually takes precedence over other resolution methods:

- Per-server IP address to host database
- Administrator-managed.
