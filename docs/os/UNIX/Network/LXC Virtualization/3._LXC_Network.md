# LXC Network Example

Be aware that many details have been omitted and would be required to make this a functioning example.

- The real machine is connected to an ISP providing DHCP services assigning our adapter an address of 192.168.0.187.
- The real machine is using KVM and deployed libvirtd which provides dhcp services in the subnet of 192.168.122.0 on the devices connected to Virt-bridge-1.
- Our Virtual Machine is connected to Virt-Bridge-1 via the virtual adapter Virt-NIC-1 and is assigned an IP Address of 192.168.122.223.
- Additionally, the Virtual-Machine has a dhcp server provided by its instance of libvirt. The default address of 192.168.122.1 for the dhcp server on Virtual-Machine has to be altered to avoid conflicts with the dhcp server running on the real machine. In this example the dhcp server on the Virtual--
- Machine was moved to the subnet 192.168.124.0.
- A second virtual bridge, Virt-Bridge-2 and virtual adapter Virt-NIC-2 were created on Virtual-Machine by libvirtd.
- The lxc-container default configuration looks for the bridge by name. The libvirtd generated bridge is usually called virbr0. In this example the lxc default bridge was changed from lxbr0 to virbr0.
- The LXC-container will receive an IP Address from the dhcp server on the Virtual-Machine. In this example the address is: 192.168.142.223.
