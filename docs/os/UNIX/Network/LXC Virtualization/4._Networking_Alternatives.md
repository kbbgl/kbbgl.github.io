# Networking Alternatives

There are alternatives for network configuration, not just libvirt. The alternatives in the configuration of the network usually center around the selection of hypervisor. Network configuration for Virtual Machines and LXC containers can be created with:

lxc-net
libvirt
VMware Workstation
Oracle VirtualBox
The list is a sample of some applications that can create and manage the bridges and virtual adapters that lxc containers can attach to.

Creation of bridges and connections to virtual interfaces can be done with the commands ip and bridge. The dnsmasq application is popular for dhcpd services (the command brctl is deprecated and not available on most distributions). It is more common to use frontend application to assist with the network configuration (usually lxc network configurations).

`lxc-net`:
`lxc-net` is available with most packages of `lxc`. The location of the configuration files is distribution dependent. An example of a `lxc-net` set up for CentOS:

```bash
USE_LXC_BRIDGE="true"
LXC_BRIDGE="lxcbr0"
LXC_ADDR="10.0.3.1"
LXC_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
LXC_NETWORK="10.0.3.0/24"
LXC_DHCP_RANGE="10.0.3.2,10.0.3.254"
LXC_DHCP_MAX="253"
LXC_DHCP_C
LXC_DOMAIN=""
```

`libvirt`:
`libvirt` provides a GUI (`virt-manager`) and CLI (`virsh`) to manage the configuration files.
