# `netplan` System Events

During system initialization, `systemd` launches a series of system-generators very early in the startup phase. These generators help with low-level setup on items.

In the `netplan` case, the `netplan generate` command is called. `netplan generate` builds the network configuration from the netplan yaml files in the `/etc/netplan/` directory and installs the configuration in the temporary configuration location.

This location on a `NetworkManager`-based stack is `/run/NetworkManager/system-connections/name.nmconnection`.

When `NetworkManager` starts, it processes all the configurations in the `/run`... directory.

For example, we can find the password for a network adapter within `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`:

```bash
cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml | grep password -B1
             access-points:
                 MY_AP:
                     password: PASSWORD
```
