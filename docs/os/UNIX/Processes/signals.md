# Signals

Signals are used to notify processes of events/exceptions and are the basis of Inter Process Communication (**IPC**).

Signals can be sent to processes:

- From the kernel to a user process as a result of a programming error/exception.
- From a user process to the kernel (using a system call) to a user process.
- Only between processes owned by the same user or by the superuser.

Signals are used to handle:

- Exceptions detected by hardware (illegal memory reference).
- Exceptions generated by the environment (user killed process)

`kill` can be used to send a signal to processes:

```bash
kill 1991
kill -9 1991
kill -SIGKILL 1991
```

`killall` can be used to send signals to multiple processes with a common name pattern:

```bash
killall bash
killall -9 bash
killall -SIGTERM bash
```

`pkill` is used to send a signal to processes using specific conditions:

```bash
pkill -HUP rsyslogd
```
